_Disclaimer: I use figma extensively and am very biased in my valuation of the company. I consider figma a work-of-an-art software with potential to break bounderies of product innovation. I also believe Figma to be a once-in-a-decade investment opportunity given their crazy potential, talent, and leadership. I also intend to purchase FIGMA stock. This is not an investment advice. Please consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions. The article is for educational purposes._

## My FIGMA Story

So far I have ideated an app, two websites, and made over $1500 doing design works with Figma. I have spend zero dollars on Figma so far, however, given an opportunity to spend, I won't hesitate. I am by no means a professional illustrator/designer, however, I posses simple drag and drop knowdlege. The more time I spend exploring Figma, the more I realize its potential. I have spend over 200 hours working in, and still have only barely touched the surface. With MCPs, I have increasingly seen Figma integrations in AI end-user applications like Claude and ChatGPT. I believe these integrations are goign to be game changers, for users, FIGMA the company, and also the AI apps that connect with Figma.

Figma's most recent quarterly earnings puts quarter over quarter growth at 10%.

> Figma went from 5945 paid customers to 12,910 paid customers in the $10,000+ range in two years, a 117% growth. The company's S-1 filing puts these customers as 64% of annual recurring revenue.

![Figma $100,000+ paid customers chart](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579878/000162828025036090/paidcustomers_100k.jpg)

### Figma generates around 34% of ARR from its smaller clients

Figma generates 64% of revenue from customers spending more than $10K which also includes the cohort spending more than $100K annually. This deducts individuals and small businesses revenue segment to represent 34% of Figma's total ARR. Figma's highest ARR comes from it's biggest customers, which have nearly tripled in number in the past 2 years.

## Discount Cash Flow Valuation of FIGMA (NYSE:FIG)

Two years ago, Adobe wanted to buy figma for $20bn. The deal failed and as part of the breakup, figma received a billion dollars. Since then, the company went public, reached an all-time-high price of $142 per shareand is currently $34 a pop, closely circling it's IPO price.

The company generated $274mn in its most recent quarter, crossed a $1bn a year ARR, and has a $51mn quarterly net positive operating cash flow according to the most recent quartely filings. In other words, Figma is a billion dollar revenue public company growing at a 40% yoy rate, has managed to become profitable and it's stock is trading at IPO prices.

Profitability, strong growth, IPO level prices are trifectas rarely seen among tech and software companies whose marketcap hover around Figma's, so it is only natural to think, is this my **investing early in google** moment? I am particularly fond of Figma's products and my investment philosophy dictates to invest in companies whose products I frequently use and love.

A DCF valuation of Figma gives a rational, conservative, and realistic estimate of what Figma's stock price should look like. I did the valuation for my own investment purposes and came with results that give the scenarios to justify my investment rationale.

### Rationales For Figma Valuation

Everybody has their own version of investing early in Google or Apple or Microsoft. While I wasn't even born when these companies went public, in the case of Figma, I was using their software and actually making money. My early startup prototypes were made in Figma, and wiring things in Figma helped me tremendously in the deliberation process. I have kind of an infatutation for this company and given the stock price is below IPO prices, it's only natural to want to invest in software that I like and use often.

Figma crossed a billion dollar revenue mark and that means a lot for a pure software play. Given the company scales top line in the 25%-40% range for the coming decade, we are looking at a software firm thagt generates some 10 billion in annual revenues and has operating margins of 30-40% within a decade.

Here's some other rationales for conducting this valuation

- Figma has a strong balance sheet with more than $1.5bn in current assets and virtually zero debt
- Figma's growth rate is impressive at a 30-40% annual growth rate
- Figma has customers in all ranges, from individuals to small businesses and design firms to enterprises and corporations like Netflix and Duilingo.
- I have made money using Figma's design products with impressive customer satisfaction on the design output.
- I take Figma as a innovative software company that currently focuses on building cool design product. Their ethos is towards building collaborative tools that help build meaningful products. I easily see Figma building cool software that are not even thought of yet.
- Figma's MCP and collaborations with AI applications like ChatGPT and Claude will do them positive in terms of customer acquisiton and retention
- Figma is globally known and is building impressive brand value.

## Explaining the valuation inputs

- Figma's annual Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) is $250 million. I used the Net Cash Provided by Operating activities for 9 months ended 2025 and added $40mn extra to round up for the year of 2025 to reach this number.
- Figma's Capital Spending (CAPEX) stands at $217 factoring in the recent $200mn acquition of Weave AI and general Capital Expenditures of 17 million for 2025.
- Figma's Net Operating Loss Carried Forward stands at $1023mn , derived from recent SEC filings.
- Figma's Marginal Tax Rate is set at 25%, a common practice for profitable public companies in the long run. They could end up paying less.
- Figma's Current Beta is set at 1.35. I don't have a clear explanation for this. So take this with a grain of salt.
- Figma's current cost of borrowing is kept at a relatively high rate of 10% to keep valuation conservating. Also, the company is relatively new in public markets.
- Figma's revenue / top line growth rate is set at 30%. Figma has consistenyl growth above the 30% range, with recent YoY growth at 40%. Again, the number is personal, as we can't predict the future.
- I set Figma's long-term operating margins at 35% witha. 1.8 speed of convergence, meaning, the company will have 35% operating margins in the long run, however, it might tale them more than 5 years to do so. Figma has tremendous opportunities to Capex and conduct R&D which will significantly drive up their operating expenses. I believe in the management and they will eventually turn massively profitable.

One can tell I am biased in this valuation, and that's okay.
