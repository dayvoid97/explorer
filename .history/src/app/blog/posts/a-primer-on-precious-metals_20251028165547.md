## Introduction

This article is a primer for trading **Gold and Silver**, covering how to get started, what to look for, and which instruments are suitable for different account sizes. We focus on **volatility** and **trading instruments** as key considerations.

The goal is simple: There is significant opportunity in commodities trading, but volatility can be a killer if not respected.

> Note: This is not a "bull thesis for Gold" article. Market participants may have varying views. Our perspective: given macroeconomic trends, rising U.S. debt, and elevated equity valuations, **USD-denominated commodities like Gold are likely to rise**. Traders flock to rising prices, creating further momentum.

## Key Drivers of the Commodities Supercycle

1. **Macroeconomic Fundamentals**
   - Global demand from **individuals, institutions, and central banks** is surging.
   - Goldman Sachs predicts Gold could surpass **$4,000/oz** backed by central bank demand and Fed monetary easing.

| Year | Central Bank Demand (Tonnes) |
| ---- | ---------------------------- |
| 2020 | 254.9                        |
| 2021 | 450.1                        |
| 2022 | 1080.0                       |
| 2023 | 1050.0                       |
| 2024 | 1089.4                       |

2. **Dollar Debasement Argument**

   - US debt exceeds $38 trillion.
   - Fed monetary easing lowers the USD’s store-of-value appeal.
   - Hard assets like Gold and Silver become attractive alternatives.
   - Track **DXY Index** for USD strength: [Yahoo Finance – DXY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB/)

3. **The Mother of All Bubbles**
   - Veteran trader [Christian Klien](https://x.com/clkleinmonaco) warns: when financial bubbles burst, hard assets like Gold remain the safest refuge.
