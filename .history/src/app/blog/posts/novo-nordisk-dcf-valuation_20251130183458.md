## tldr : Novo Nordisk is still undervalued in a value-trap scenario

Assuming Novo Nordisk will see zero high-growth period in upcoming future, I value the companh's share at 377 DKK a pop, implying a potential for 17% return in case of Novo Nordisk being a value trap company.

I am actually optimistic on Novo Nordisk's future growth, and my valuation gives a 617 DKK per share value of the company's class B Shares, implying a potential 114% upside for investments.

## Novo Nordisk Growth Story - Diabetes + Obesity Care

Insulin and Diabetes Care medications generated more than 75% of Novo Nordisk's total revenue in 2020. Add Wegovy to the mix and fast forward 2024, the segmant makes a whopping 92% of total revenue. Total revenue itself scaled up 2.5X in the past four years.

## Novo Nordisk Valuation DCF Inputs

> This Discounted Cash Flow Intrinsic Valuation of Novo Nordisk in Danish Currency is done in the valuation template provided by Prof. Aswath Damodaran of NYU Stern. I give my immense thanks and gratitude to Prof. Damodaran for I learnt my valuation techniques reading his lectures and experimenting on his spreadsheets. Most of the global and industry numbers used in the valuation also come from his data series.

- Rate of Growth Assumption: Novo Nordisk has a history of innovation and deep specialization in developing medications for blood and heart related ailments. The company has an impressive pipeline in Diabetes, Obesity, Rare Diseases, and Cardiovascular and Emerging Therapy Areas. Patents for Ozempic®, Wegovy®, and Rybelsus® are good till 2032 in the US and 2031 in Europe, with the nearest expiration date of 2026 for China. Morgan stanley [estimates](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/weight-loss-medication-market-unstoppable-growth) the weight loss segment could rise to $150bn by 2035 from $15bn in 2024. Similarly, Wegovy has [FDA approval](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-approves-treatment-serious-liver-disease-known-mash) for NASH/MASH treatements, a treatement market expected to grow at at a CAGR of 17.7% till 2033.
- Novo Nordisk's CapEx and Acquisitons are in place showcasing the company expects sustained and increasing demand for their top-selling products. Given the sustained trend of weight loss medications and Ozempic's efficacy in treatement of type-2 diabetes, I do not expect any significant decline in top line growth. Type-2 diabetes and weight management are not going anywhere, and neither is Novo Nordisk's positon in treatement of these diseases, regardless of what the media says.
- Novo Nordisk recently failed to gain FDA approval as the Evoke Phase 3 trial [did not demonstrate](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/353278/000117184325007519/f6k_112425.htm) a statistically significant reduction in Alzheimer's disease progression. While not a current success, Novo Nordisk has the R&D capital required to keep up with their trails, which upon success would be a completely new avenue for growth. Treatements for Alzheimer's disease are expected to grow at a CAGR of 23.4% till 2032 to reach $19bn. I do not include any growth that could potentially come from this market in conducting this valuation.
- Cost of Capital of 7.9% accouting for equity and debt part of the capital. Refer to the Cost of Capital worksheet in the attached Google Sheets to see how this number appears.
- I give Novo Nordisk a high growth rate of 11.13% for 5-years because I believe the company's revenue growth is not stopping anytime soon. Although not as impressive as North America growth, Novo Nordisk managed to get an impressive 70% growth in it's international segment from 2020 to 2024. I maintain growth will be sustained.

  **Novo Nordisk Revenue Breakdown by Region 2020 and 2024**
  |Segmant|2020 Revenue|2024 Revenue|Growth|
  |---|---|---|---|
  |North America|61,117|178,172|191%|
  |International|65,829|112,231|70.5%|

  ***

- Effective tax rate of 20.4% derived from financial statements.
- ROIC during stable growth is set at 25% for industry average growth. Current Return on Invested Capital of 47% is based on current inputs.

## Per Share Value of Novo Nordisk

Based on the inputs and assumptions, I derive a 617 DKK per share value for Novo Nordisk Class B Shares. Novo Nordisk currently trades for 317 DKK per share, implying a severe undervaluation based on my estimates.

# Conclusion

Novo Nordisk remains one of the most influential healthcare companies in the world. As the producer of roughly half of the global insulin supply, the company operates an extensive international network of manufacturing, distribution, and research facilities. Its brand recognition is exceptionally strong — the Novo Nordisk logo is familiar even in remote regions across Asia and Africa.

With the breakout success of Ozempic and Wegovy, Novo Nordisk has accelerated capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions to expand capacity and secure long-term growth. These investments position the company to scale production and meet rising global demand for metabolic and obesity treatments.

Based on my DCF valuation and the company’s structural strengths, I view Novo Nordisk as an attractive addition to a long-term portfolio at current price levels.
