_Disclaimer: I use figma extensively and might be biased in my valuation of the company. I consider figma a work-of-an-art software, sort of my early days Apple the computer maker. I also believe Figma to be a once-in-a-decade investment opportunity given their crazy potential, talent, and leadership. I also intend to purchase FIGMA stock. This is not an investment advice. Please consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions. The article is for educational purposes. _
