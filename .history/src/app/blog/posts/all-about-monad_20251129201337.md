## Introduction

Monad’s Mission “is "_to power a new world economy, suitable for a world that is increasingly online and onchain, through state-of-the-art financial infrastructure_" via the pillars of

1. **The Best Developer Experience**: Seamless EVM compatibility and awesome initiates like Monad Madness, [Monad Founder Residency](https://residency.monad.xyz/) connect developers and founders in the Monad ecosystem to investors and businesses to build new blockchain-based services. Monad also has impressive physical locations where builders can meetup and discuss the next big ideas. Visit [The Studio](https://x.com/thestudio_xyz).
2. **Global Reach & Impact**: Monad aims to expand high-performance blockchain infrastructure worldwide, emphasizing emerging markets driving real crypto adoption. This includes Latin America’s fast-growing blockchain payments ecosystem and enterprise-level deployments in Southeast Asia, where scalability and low-cost transactions are crucial. Monad positions itself as the financial backbone for global, permissionless value transfer.
3. **Best in-class Technology**: Powered by innovations like [MonadDB](https://docs.monad.xyz/monad-arch/execution/monaddb) and [Parallel Execution](https://docs.monad.xyz/monad-arch/execution/parallel-execution), Monad claims to have achieved 10,000+ transactions per second throughput required for mainstream applications such as high-frequency trading, real-time payments, and consumer apps demanding instant settlement. High transaction throughput, combined with EVM compatibility is Monad’s approach to tap into the world's largest developer community in the blockchain space with scalability with minimal friction.

## Switching to Monad network on Metamask

**Monad is an L1 network, meaning it's on the same tier as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana. The process of switching from Ethereum to Monad is similar to switching from Ethereum to Solana. The same process applies for switching from Solana or other networks to Monad network**

Monad blockchain is supported by most major wallet providers. With Metamask, you can simply swap your tokens for Monad. Make sure you have added Monad Blockchain as one of the accepted networks. Simply select the Monad Network or All Popular Networks to access Monad features in Metamask.

Phanton wallet also has Monad network integration by default. It's as simple as selecting either Ethereum or Solana mainnet. Simply switch and select a different network.

## Briding your tokens to MONAD

Use [MonadBridge](https://monadbridge.com/?toChain=Monad&toToken=MON) to bridge your tokens from other blockchains to Monad. I bridged my ETH tokens to MON tokens from Ethereum mainnet to Monad public mainnet wallet using MonadBridge. MonadBridge.com allows you to select a different wallet to transfer your bridged asset.

Select your destination wallet and you will receive the tokens. Monad bridging from ETH mainnet to Monad mainnet happened under 15 seconds with a small transaction cost.

1. **Staking** : Stake your MON tokens to earn a 15.41% APY. _Note this could change anytime_.
