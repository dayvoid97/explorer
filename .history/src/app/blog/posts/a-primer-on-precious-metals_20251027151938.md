## Introduction

This article is a primer on Precious Metals. Materials viewers come across in this page is items that have been derived from commodity traders and folks in the precious metals education sector. I make use of these materials myself and thus I am writing this article. The goal is simple: There is ample money to be made trading commodities, however, we have to be wary and cautious because volatility is a killer, really.

## How big are Gold and Silver Markets?

The market capitalization of total above-ground gold reserves stand at $27.8trillion at current market price of 4000 per ounce.

Silver's market cap stands at $2.269tn at current market prices of $46.7 per ounce.

Needless to say, these are big numbers - gold's market cap alone is the size of US GDP at current prices.

## Who are the biggest players in the Gold and Silver Market?

## How much gold is mined every year?

## China Gold Holdings

## How to Trade Gold and Silver

There are multiple ways to get a direct exposure to gold and silver marekts:

- Gold Stocks and ETFs
- Directly Holding Gold and Silver Bars and Coins
- Gold and Silver Futures Markets

## Things To Consider

- _Watchout for Volatility bands_
  Checkout on volatility levels. High volatility means there's a bigger range for price movement. You might get burnt by volatility.

- _How big is your allowance for loss?_
  If you're looking to not lose $100 per contract while trading futures, go for Gold Micro Futures. They move the same, however, for a 1 point movement, it's $10 in profit/loss, rather than the $100. For beginners, this is a good range. Take multiple contracts, manage your risks accordingly.

- _Follow the smart ones_
  Follow the folks in the game. Get good advice. Remember, a commodity supercycle is our one wat to step out of the rat race and make something out of the movement.
