_Disclaimer: I use figma extensively and might be biased in my valuation of the company. I consider figma a work-of-an-art software, sort of my early days Apple the computer maker. I also believe Figma to be a once-in-a-decade investment opportunity given their crazy potential, talent, and leadership. I also intend to purchase FIGMA stock. This is not an investment advice. Please consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions. The article is for educational purposes._

## My FIGMA Story

So far I have ideated an app, two websites, and made over $1500 doing design works with Figma. I have spend zero dollars on Figma so far, however, given an opportunity to spend, I won't hesitate. I am by no means a professional illustrator/designer, however, I posses simple drag and drop knowdlege. The more time I spend exploring Figma, the more I realize its potential. I have spend over 200 hours working in, and still have only barely touched the surface. With MCPs, I have increasingly seen Figma integrations in AI end-user applications like Claude and ChatGPT. I believe these integrations are goign to be game changers, for users, FIGMA the company, and also the AI apps that connect with Figma.
