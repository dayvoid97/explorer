## MP Materials Valuation Primer

This is the first article in the valuation series at Financial Gurkha. In this article, we are valuing MP Materials, a leading company in the rare-earth mining and processing sector in charge of operating the only rare-earth materials extracting and processing facility in the North American continent, the Mountain Pass mine in California, southwest of Nevada.

In Stage III of the company's development, MP Materials has begun [trial production of NdPr metals](https://twitter.com/MPMaterials/status/1720170905085911278).

The impetus for this MP Materials valuation is the recent news relating to [China's export ban of rare-earth and permanent magnets related technology](https://financialgurkha.com/blog/china-rare-earth-tech-export-ban-helps-mp-materials-stock), and MP Material's recent success in manufacturing, albeit in test phase, NdPr Permanent Magnets. With giants like GM Motors already in the line to secure MP Materials products, we believe the company is going to ride high waves.

**MP Materials has an impressive revenue growth year over year. The TTM 2023 revenue backslide is due to a decrease in the price of REE oxides by more than 50% in the year 2023.**

The news in 2023 for MP Materials, ranging from manufacturing of Permanent Magnets to China's Export Ban on rare-earth related technologies, suggests that MP Materials will continue to grow in their core business. We assume MP Material will capture 30% market share in the long run given the backdrop of aggressive electrification of the automobile industry and massive investments in renewable energy.

## The Valuation Framework

We want to thank Professor Aswath Damodaran, the "Dean of Valuation" at NYU Stern who has graciously been publishing insights on valuation, corporate finance and financial markets in general in his [Musing on Markets](https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com) blog. We highly recommend everyone to read his blog. He is one of the best and we owe a great deal to his work.

We have used Dr. Damodaran's valuation template, borrowing the Tesla Motors valuation template to make modifications to bring the MP Materials Valuation to fruition.
