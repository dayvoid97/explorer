_Disclaimer: I use figma extensively and might be biased in my valuation of the company. I believe figma to be a once-in-a-decade investment opportunity given their crazy potential and talent. I also intend to purchase FIGMA stock. This is not an investment advice. The article is for educational purposes. _
