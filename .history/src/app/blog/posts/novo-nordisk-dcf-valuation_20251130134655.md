## Novo Nordisk Growth Story

Ozempic and Wegovy are Novo Nordisk's superhit drugs, accounting for

Novo Nordisk first received FDA approval for Ozempic (semaglutide) on December 5, 2017. At that time, it was simply approved as an add-on to diet and exercise to help adults with type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar.

The real turning point came in January 2020, when the FDA expanded Ozempic’s label—not for general diabetes use, but specifically to reduce major cardiovascular risks like heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular-related death in people with type 2 diabetes who also had heart disease. This shifted Ozempic’s story from just a diabetes drug to one that could also protect the heart, opening up a much larger clinical and commercial opportunity.

But the biggest change for Novo Nordisk happened in June 2021 with the FDA approval of Wegovy, a higher-dose version of semaglutide. Wegovy was approved specifically for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or those who were overweight. This marked Novo Nordisk’s major entry into the booming obesity-care market and set the stage for the massive demand the company is seeing today.
