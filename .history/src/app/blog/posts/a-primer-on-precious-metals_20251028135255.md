## Few items seemilgly important but irrelevant

There are some questions we like to make big deal out of, however, is useless noise. Questions that begin with the 'China' word, like how much gold does China hold, how big is the Chinese gold market, ignore these questions. Gold, in its global definition, is a precious commodity coveted globally that _also_ has industrial application and is generally considered to be a safe-haven asset by people worldwide. Major central banks across the world hold significant chunk of gold, and Gold has a history of being coveted by normies across the asian world, be it Nepal, China, India, Vietnam, or Japan. Some cultures go nuts for gold, others haven't had reasons to be so. Either way, gold's place as a below-risk asset holds true globally.

## Why are we in a commodities supercycle?

Multiple fronts to this answer:

- Views on USD, macroeconomics, and bubble pops. This is from my dear friend Christian, a veteral commodities trader.
- "Depends what you views are in macro and above all the usd. If you believe like me that the equity market is in the largest bubble known to man kind and therefore bound to fail at some point, the only remaining refuge are hard assets. Furthermore if you believe that the 38 trln doll gvt debt will lead the Fed to print more usd and lower interest rates will lead to further depreciation of the ccy, you need to be bullish all doll denominated ccies"
  What does this mean? In simple terms - if equities are in a bubble, and bubbles eventually pop, asset refugre is to be found in hard assets. Furthermore, the US lowering interest rates and printing more dollars will lead to further dollar devaluation which is directly reflected in appreciating prices of all those hard assets denominated in USD terms. Gold, Crude, Silver, you name it, you pick it. Dollar devaluation with itself can be check with the dy/dx numbers

## How to Trade Gold and Silver | Instruments Offered

There are multiple ways to get a direct exposure to gold and silver marekts:

- Gold Stocks and ETFs
- Directly Holding Gold and Silver Bars and Coins
- Gold and Silver Futures Markets

## Things To Consider

- _Watchout for Volatility bands_
  Checkout on volatility levels. High volatility means there's a bigger range for price movement. You might get burnt by volatility.

- _How big is your allowance for loss?_
  If you're looking to not lose $100 per contract while trading futures, go for Gold Micro Futures. They move the same, however, for a 1 point movement, it's $10 in profit/loss, rather than the $100. For beginners, this is a good range. Take multiple contracts, manage your risks accordingly.

- _Follow the smart ones_
  Follow the folks in the game. Get good advice. Remember, a commodity supercycle is our one wat to step out of the rat race and make something out of the movement.
