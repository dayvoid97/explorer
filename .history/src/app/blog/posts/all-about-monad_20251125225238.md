# A Primer on Monad

## Introduction

Monad’s Mission “is "_to power a new world economy, suitable for a world that is increasingly online and onchain, through state-of-the-art financial infrastructure_" via the pillars of

1. **The Best Developer Experience**: Seamless EVM compatibility and awesome initiates like Monad Madness, [Monad Founder Residency](https://residency.monad.xyz/) connect developers and founders in the Monad ecosystem to investors and businesses to build new blockchain-based services. Monad also has impressive physical locations where builders can meetup and discuss the next big ideas. Visit [The Studio](https://x.com/thestudio_xyz).
2. **Global Reach & Impact**: Monad aims to expand high-performance blockchain infrastructure worldwide, emphasizing emerging markets driving real crypto adoption. This includes Latin America’s fast-growing blockchain payments ecosystem and enterprise-level deployments in Southeast Asia, where scalability and low-cost transactions are crucial. Monad positions itself as the financial backbone for global, permissionless value transfer.
3. **Best in-class Technology**: Powered by innovations like [MonadDB](https://docs.monad.xyz/monad-arch/execution/monaddb) and [Parallel Execution](https://docs.monad.xyz/monad-arch/execution/parallel-execution), Monad claims to have achieved 10,000+ transactions per second throughput required for mainstream applications such as high-frequency trading, real-time payments, and consumer apps demanding instant settlement. High transaction throughput, combined with EVM compatibility is Monad’s approach to tap into the world's largest developer community in the blockchain space with scalability with minimal friction.

## Monad Public Sale & Airdrop Distribution

## Briding your tokens to MONAD

Use [MonadBridge](https://monadbridge.com/?toChain=Monad&toToken=MON) to bridge your tokens from other blockchains to Monad. I bridged my ETH to MON tokens from L1 Ethereum to Monad Blockchain. MonadBridge.com allows you to send your bridged Monad token to a different wallet. Select your destination wallet and you will receive the tokens. Monad bridging from ETH happened under 15 seconds with a small transaction cost.

## Check Monad Blockchain and MON Token Data

MON tokens are currently trading for 4 cents a piece. To make the most out of the Monad blockchain and MON tokens without technical/developer experience, stake your MON tokens with participating validators to generate a 15.4% yield on your stakes. Start with less than $10 and see exceptional returns.

1. **Staking** : Stake your MON tokens to earn a 15.41% APY. This could change anytime. As Monad is a Proof of Stake (POS) mechanism, staking secures the network and insures the validators have a financial incentive to act honestly. Currently 12.8 billion MON tokens are staked, represeing a 12.8% of total MON supply of 100 billion. You can stake as little as 1 MON token, which is currently trading for 4 cents a piece. Learn more via [Staking on Monad](https://www.gmonads.com/staking).

2. **Validators**: The Validators tab gives a list of all the public validators of the Monad blockchain ecosystem. Currently there are 164 validators. While staking MON tokens, you need to choose a validator and stake with them. Monad blockchain has a 25 MON reward per block generation and validators take a 10% cut of each block reward, meaning 22.5 MON is distributed among the stakes who choose a validator to stake.
