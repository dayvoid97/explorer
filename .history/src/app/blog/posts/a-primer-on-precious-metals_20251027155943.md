## Few items seemilgly important but irrelevant

There are some questions we like to make big deal out of, however, is useless noise. Questions that begin with the 'China' word, like how much gold does China hold, how big is the Chinese gold market, ignore these questions. Gold, in its global definition, is a precious commodity coveted globally that _also_ has industrial application and is generally considered to be a safe-haven asset by people worldwide. Major central banks across the world hold significant chunk of gold, and Gold has a history of being coveted by normies across the asian world, be it Nepal, China, India, Vietnam, or Japan. Some cultures go nuts for gold, others haven't had reasons to be so. Either way, gold's place as a below-risk asset holds true globally.

## How to Trade Gold and Silver

There are multiple ways to get a direct exposure to gold and silver marekts:

- Gold Stocks and ETFs
- Directly Holding Gold and Silver Bars and Coins
- Gold and Silver Futures Markets

## Things To Consider

- _Watchout for Volatility bands_
  Checkout on volatility levels. High volatility means there's a bigger range for price movement. You might get burnt by volatility.

- _How big is your allowance for loss?_
  If you're looking to not lose $100 per contract while trading futures, go for Gold Micro Futures. They move the same, however, for a 1 point movement, it's $10 in profit/loss, rather than the $100. For beginners, this is a good range. Take multiple contracts, manage your risks accordingly.

- _Follow the smart ones_
  Follow the folks in the game. Get good advice. Remember, a commodity supercycle is our one wat to step out of the rat race and make something out of the movement.
