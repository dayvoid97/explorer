_Disclaimer: I use figma extensively and might be biased in my valuation of the company. I consider figma a work-of-an-art software, sort of my early days Apple the computer maker. I also believe Figma to be a once-in-a-decade investment opportunity given their crazy potential, talent, and leadership. I also intend to purchase FIGMA stock. This is not an investment advice. Please consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions. The article is for educational purposes._

## My FIGMA Story

So far I have ideated an app, two websites, and made over $1500 doing design works with Figma. I have spend zero dollars on Figma so far, however, given an opportunity to spend, I won't hesitate. I am by no means a professional illustrator/designer, however, I posses simple drag and drop knowdlege. The more time I spend exploring Figma, the more I realize its potential. I have spend over 200 hours working in, and still have only barely touched the surface. With MCPs, I have increasingly seen Figma integrations in AI end-user applications like Claude and ChatGPT. I believe these integrations are goign to be game changers, for users, FIGMA the company, and also the AI apps that connect with Figma.

## Discount Cash Flow Valuation of FIGMA (NYSE:FIG)

Two years ago, Adobe wanted to buy figma for $20bn. The deal failed and as part of the breakup, figma received a billion dollars. Since then, the company went public, it's reaching an all-time-high of $142 in its second trading day. Figma currently trades at $34 a pop, closely circling it's IPO price of $33 per share.

The company generated $274mn in its most recent quarter, crossed a $1bn a year ARR, and has a $51mn quarterly net positive operating cash flow according to the most recent quartely filings. In other words, Figma is a public company that has managed to become profitable and is around it's IPO price with an impressive double digit growth rate.

Profitability, strong growth, IPO level prices are trifectas rarely seen among tech and software companies whose marketcap hover around what Figma is valued at, so it is only natural to think, is this my **investing early in google** moment? I am particularly fond of Figma's products and my investment philosophy dictates to invest in companies whose products I frequently use and love.

A DCF valuation of Figma gives a rational, conservative, and realistic estimate of what Figma's stock price should look like. I did the valuation for my own investment purposes and came with results that give the scenarios to justify my investment rationale.

### Rationales For Figma Valuation

> Figma has a strong balance sheet with more than $1.5bn in current assets and virtually zero debt
> Figma's growth rate is impressive at a 30-40% annual growth rate
> Figma has customers in all ranges, from individuals to small businesses and design firms to enterprises and corporations like Netflix and Duilingo.
> I have made money using Figma's design products with impressive customer satisfaction on the design output.
> I take Figma as a innovative software company that currently focuses on building cool design product. Their ethos is towards building collaborative tools that help build meaningful products. I easily see Figma building cool software that are not even thought of yet.
> Figma's MCP and collaborations with AI applications like ChatGPT and Claude will do them positive in terms of customer acquisiton and retention
> Figma is globally known and is building impressive brand value.

One can tell I am biased in this valuation, and that's okay.
