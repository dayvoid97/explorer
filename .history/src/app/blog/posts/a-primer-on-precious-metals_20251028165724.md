## Introduction

This article is a primer for trading **Gold and Silver**, covering how to get started, what to look for, and which instruments are suitable for different account sizes. We focus on **volatility** and **trading instruments** as key considerations.

The goal is simple: There is significant opportunity in commodities trading, but volatility can be a killer if not respected.

> Note: This is not a "bull thesis for Gold" article. Market participants may have varying views. Our perspective: given macroeconomic trends, rising U.S. debt, and elevated equity valuations, **USD-denominated commodities like Gold are likely to rise**. Traders flock to rising prices, creating further momentum.

## Why Trade Commodities Now?

The commodities supercycle is here—a prolonged bull market for commodities expected to last a decade or more. At 28, time is on my side to capitalize on this trend.

I personally trade **Gold micro futures** via **TopStep Prop Trading** (no commission earned by me; this article is not an endorsement).

## Few items seemilgly important but irrelevant

There are some questions we like to make big deal out of, however, are insignificant when factored in. Questions that begin with the 'China' word, like how much gold does China hold, how fast is China's holdings increasing, how big is the Chinese gold market, ignore these questions. Gold, in its global definition, is a precious commodity coveted globally that _also_ has industrial application and is generally considered to be a safe-haven asset by people worldwide. Major central banks across the world hold significant amount of gold, and the metal has always had a history of being coveted by regular folks alike. Some cultures go nuts for gold, others haven't had reasons to be so. Either way, gold's place as a below-risk asset holds true globally.

Important to consider is the fact that central banks have more than doubled their gold holdings while decreasing treasury and other paper holdings for their own reasons. Gold as a part of culture is going to stay irregardless of its price in regions across the globe where it already has strong hold. Insititutions, private investors and ETFs will most certainly increase their physical holdings as it becomes increasingly more attractive to hold and offer gold-based financial products.

## Why are we in a commodities supercycle?

There are multiple fronts to answering this question. The macroeconomic view, the dollar debasement arguemnt, and finally, the mother of all bubbles: Most of the reasoning here comes from my dear friend and a veteran commodity trader [Christian Klien](https://x.com/clkleinmonaco).

- The Macroeconomic View: Gold is being coveted by everyone now - from individuals to central banks to institutional investors. Goldman Sachs analysts predicted gold to rise above $4000 per ounce backed by strong fundamentals of **strong structural demand from central banks** and **monetary easing from the Federal Reserve**. Central banks across the world have agressively coveted gold in years post-pandemic. According to Gold.com, central bank demand for gold has almost doubled from 2022 to 2025 compared to the highest in the past two decades. Check the stats below.

| Year | Central Bank Demand (in tonnes) |
| ---- | ------------------------------- |
| 2020 | 254.9                           |
| 2021 | 450.1                           |
| 2022 | 1080.0                          |
| 2023 | 1050                            |
| 2024 | 1089.4                          |

_Data is from Gold.com_

- The Dollar Debasement View: The United States of America currently has debt exceeding $38 trillion and it's going up every year. According to Christian Klien, a veteran commodities trader, "if you believe that the 38 trillion doll gvt debt will lead the Fed to print more USD and lower interest rates will lead to further depreciation of the currentcy, you need to be bullish all dollar denominated currencies." When interest rates fall and more dollars are printed, it starts becoming unattractive to hold dollar as the storage of value factor in dollar begins declining with time. Times like this lead people to invest in hard assets like Gold and Silver. We can analyze the DXY index to compute dollar's relative strength compared to the basket of global currencies.

- The Mother of all Bubbles: Chrisitan also believe we are heading towards "the largest bubble known to man kind" as he describes the upcoming bubble. His views are straightforward: When the bubble pops, the only remaining refuge will are hard assets, Gold being the hardest of them all.

## How to Trade Gold and Silver | Instruments Offered

- Directly Holding Gold and Silver Bars and Coins : You can buy Gold and Silver bars and coins. Explore various sources on the internet.
- Gold and Silver Futures Markets: The crux of this article - trading the commodity futures on Gold and Silver. Please be advised you could end up losing everything if you don't manage risk properly. Please consult your financial advisor and learn proper techniques before entering the commodities futures market.

## The Most Important Factors Factors for Trading Gold Futures

- _Watchout for Volatility bands_
  Checkout on volatility levels. High volatility means there's a bigger range for price movement. You might get burnt by volatility. You can track Gold Volatility with $GVZ. Volatility essentially gives you an average movement from mean prices, meaning, with a lower volatylity band, you can expect prices move less. Watchout for volatiltiy levels to go below 20. During the recent ATH gold prices, GVZ readings were at 33, which is a perfect time to sell your contracts for premiums. Price fluctuated widely, leading to massive trading losses if risk was not managed properly.

- _How big is your allowance for loss?_
  If you're looking to not lose $100 per contract while trading futures, go for Gold Micro Futures. They move the same, however, for a 1 point movement, it's $10 in profit/loss, rather than the $100. For beginners, this is a good range. Take multiple contracts, manage your risks accordingly. Never Forget: We are in a multi-year cycle, and the most important thing is to remain solvent and keep playing the game.

- _Follow the smart ones_
  Follow the folks in the game. Get good advice. Remember, a commodity supercycle is our one way to step out of the rat race, once and for all. Follow [Christian Klien](https://x.com/clkleinmonaco) on X for solid posts.

## Final Thoughts

A commodity super-cycle is a long game and we want to be active participants here. Watchout for volatility levels and when volatility significantly declines, we step in, one micro futures at a time. I personally use Top Step's prop trading features to participate and trade gold micro futures, where each point is $10. Given the allowance for a maximum loss of $2000 in Topstep, my range is 200 points. Try to step in when volatiltiy is low. The basic thesis is: Gold is headed towards a super cycle, has aggressi ve bullish momentum with central bank, institutions, investor, and common-folk demand. As Gold moves, so does Silver. Thank you for reading.
